**Contributing to omop2survey**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the `omop2survey` package! This guide is designed to clarify the contribution process for everyone involved. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting an enhancement, or adding new features, your participation is greatly appreciated.

Getting Started

1.	**Fork the Repository**: Navigate to the [omop2survey](/https://github.com/elifdy/omop2survey) repository and click the “Fork” button in the upper right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
2.	**Clone Your Fork**: On your GitHub fork, press the “Code” button and copy the URL to clone. Open your terminal, navigate to where you want your local repository to be placed, and run:

  	`git clone [URL of your fork]`
3. **Create a Branch**: Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):
   
   `cd omop2survey`

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

`git checkout -b your-new-branch-name`

**Making Changes**

After setting up your local repository, you’re ready to make changes. Here are some guidelines to follow:
- **Keep Changes Small and Focused**: If you’re adding a new feature or fixing a bug, keep your changes as small and focused as possible. This makes it easier for the changes to be reviewed and accepted.
- **Adhere to Coding Standards**: Make sure your code adheres to the coding standards used in `omop2survey`. If possible, use comments and documentation strings to explain why and what your code does.

**Testing**

Before submitting your changes, make sure your code passes all existing tests and add new tests if you’re introducing a new feature or functionality. This helps to ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality.

**Submitting Changes**

Once you’ve made your changes:
1.	**Push your changes to GitHub**: Push your changes to your fork:

`git push origin your-new-branch-name`

2.	**Submit a Pull Request**: Go to your repository on GitHub, you’ll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on it, review the changes, and then submit the pull request with a clear title and description.

**What Happens Next?**

Once you submit your pull request, I will review your changes. As the sole maintainer, I'll try to review contributions as promptly as possible. Here’s what you can expect:
- **Discussion and Review**: I may suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives.
- **Revisions**: Your responsiveness to feedback and additional commits will help expedite the process.
- **Approval and Merge**: Once everything is in order, I will merge your changes into the repository.
